### Troubleshooting:

**Can't connect?**
- Ensure your Pi is on the same network
- Check if port 4533 is accessible
- Try using Pi's IP address instead of hostname

**No music showing?**
- Check if Navidrome has scanned your music folder
- Verify music files are in supported formats (MP3, FLAC, etc.)
- Trigger a library scan: `docker exec navidrome /app/navidrome --scan`

**Slow loading?**
- Check your Pi's performance with `htop`
- Reduce image quality in Navidrome settings
- Ensure good WiFi connection

### Network Access:

#### Local Network Only:
Use your Pi's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100:4533`)

#### Internet Access (Advanced):
Set up port forwarding on your router:
- Forward port 4533 to your Pi
- Use your public IP or domain name
- Consider setting up HTTPS for security

### Security Notes:

1. **Change default password** in config.env
2. **Use strong passwords** for user accounts
3. **Consider VPN access** instead of port forwarding
4. **Regular updates** of all components
